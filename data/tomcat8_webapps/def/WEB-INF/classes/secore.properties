# SECORE configuration file
#
# Notes:
#  Settings should be specified in key=value pairs.
#  The server needs to be restarted for any changes in this file to take effect.
#

#------------------- Default SECORE configuration -------------------
# parameter:     db_updates.path  
# purpose:       Directory holding updates (insert, delete) CRS defintions to be changed in userdb.
# need to adapt: no
db_updates.path=/opt/rasdaman/share/rasdaman/secore

# parameter:     service.url
# purpose:       Service URL, used in automatic substitution of URNs (urn:ogc:def) and URLs (e.g: http://localhost:8080/def).
#                Set this parameter to your public service URL if you use a proxy to SECORE in localhost.
# need to adapt: yes
service.url=http://localhost:8080/def

# parameter:     codespace
# purpose:       Default codeSpace to be used for definitions constructed on the fly by crs-compound. 
#                From the GML 3.2.1 XML schema: The value of the codeSpace attribute (if present) 
#                shall indicate a dictionary, thesaurus, classification scheme, authority, or pattern for the term.
# need to adapt: no
codespace=OGC

# parameter:     server.contextPath
# purpose:       Both deployed web application as embedded/external will need this parameter as prefix
#                for controller in URL routing (e.g: http://localhost:8080/def).
# need to adapt: no
server.contextPath=/def

# parameter:     secore_admin_user
# purpose:       Login account which is allowed to access SECORE admin pages (*.jsp) to query/insert/update/delete CRS definitions from userdb collection.
# description:   Log in to http://domain:port/def/index.jsp (e.g: http://localhost:8080/def/index.jsp) to have access to other admin pages.
#                Recommendation: establish a dedicated user.
# need to adapt: yes
secore_admin_user=secoreuser

# parameter:     secore_admin_pass
# purpose:       password for secore_admin_user login, as above.
# need to adapt: yes
secore_admin_pass=secorepasswd

#------------------- Embedded SECORE configuration -------------------
# These configurations below only have effect when java_server configuration is set to embedded, i.e: java_server=external

# parameter:     java_server
# purpose:       Allow user to start SECORE with embedded (standalone web application: jar file including embedded Tomcat)
#                or external (normal web application: war file to deploy on a specific web application containter, 
#                e.g: Tomcat, GlassFish,...) mode. It is set as parameter by using -DJAVA_SERVER=embedded/external with cmake 
#                or ./configure --with-java-server=embedded/external with automake when configuring rasdaman installation.
# description:   When set to external, all settings (server.port, start_embedded_secore)
#                for embedded SECORE will be disabled.
# need to adapt: no
java_server=external

# parameter:     server.port
# purpose:       Port for embedded secore using embedded Tomcat web application container. 
#                It must be different from embedded Tomcat for Secore in secore.properties file (default is: 8080).
# need to adapt: yes
server.port=8081

# parameter:     secoredb.path
# purpose:       Path to folder where embedded secore generates BaseX files which are needed to run BaseX queries.
#                This folder will need read, write permission for the user who is running embedded secore.
#                For external secore, it will generate secoredb folder inside the servlet's webapps folder (e.g: /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/secoredb) automatically and user does not have to change anything.
# need to adapt: yes

secoredb.path=

#------------------- log4j configuration -------------------

# Configuration to write Secore's logs to secore.log file.
# need to adapt: no
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, rollingFile

# Reduce the log information from Spring
log4j.logger.org.springframework=WARN
# Reduce the log information from Hibernate

# NOTE: Select one strategy (and comment out the other!) for rolling files:
#       1. by maximum size and index (default)
#       2. by time interval

# 1. Rolling files by maximum size and index (default)
# Please make sure the path specified by log4j.appender.rollingFile.File is a
# location where the system user running Tomcat has write access.
# Otherwise, secore logs can only be found in catalina.out

# 2. Rolling files by time interval (e.g. once a day, or once a month)
# Please make sure the paths specified by log4j.appender.rollingFile.rollingPolicy.ActiveFileName
# and log4j.appender.rollingFile.rollingPolicy.FileNamePattern are locations
# where the system user running Tomcat has write access.
# Otherwise, secore logs can only be found in catalina.out
